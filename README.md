# BOSU
**Block OS Update. _It is still in the testing phase_**.

Software that stops updating on Windows-based systems. It monitors Windows Update services and iterrupts them if they are running.
# How it works
Save BOSU.exe executable file to a directory that is convenient for you. Run it and turn on Startup(Settings menu => Autostartup => Enabled). Minimize app and it wont disturbe you at all.
